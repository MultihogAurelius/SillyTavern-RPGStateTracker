# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Fatbody D&D Framework** will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Automatic State Deduplication**: Implemented a "Post-Pass Cleanup" layer that automatically detects and removes duplicate state blocks (e.g., multiple `[CHARACTER]` tags). It enforces a "Last Block Wins" rule to ensure a clean, single source of truth for the UI.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Lookback Update Option**: Added a third manual update mode that allows users to specify exactly how many past assistant turns to parse. This is useful for summarizing multi-turn dialogue or complex narrative sequences without a full context audit.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Interceptor Metadata Integrity**: Refactored the RNG/State interceptor to use in-place modification. This ensures that hidden SillyTavern metadata (like Reasoning/Thinking content) is preserved exactly as the engine expects, preventing 400 errors with models like DeepSeek R1.
- **Enhanced Thinking Stripping**: Expanded the State Model pass filter to automatically strip `<thought>`, `<thinking>`, and `<reasoning>` tags to prevent API validation errors.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Multi-Part Message Tracking**: Fixed a critical bug where the State Model failed to process narrative text generated *before* a tool call within a single AI turn. The tracker now seamlessly aggregates all assistant message chunks since the last user message.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-27

### Changed
- **Settings UI Optimization**: Removed redundant "Dice & Tools" toggles from the settings panel, as they are now handled exclusively by the interactive footer buttons.
- **System Prompt Refinement**: Hardened RNG and combat rules and unified terminology around `[RNG_QUEUE v6.0_PROPER]` across all system prompt versions.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Hybrid RNG Architecture**: Introduced a dual-system approach to random number generation.
  - **RNG Queue (Combat)**: Pre-rolled dice for speed and anti-sycophancy in structured play.
  - **Tool Call RNG (Narrative)**: Reactive, AI-driven rolling for skill checks to prevent narrative "cheating."
- **"Waterproof" Narrative Logic**: Mandatory `dc` (Difficulty Class) parameter enforced in the `RollTheDice` tool. The AI must now commit to a difficulty *before* seeing the roll result.
- **Enhanced SYSPROMPT Selector**: Added a multi-version popup menu to the `SYSPROMPT` button, allowing users to choose between the **Modern (Hybrid)** and **Legacy (Queue-only)** system prompts.
- **Dynamic Footer UI**: Completely refactored the footer buttons with an "Accordion Squeeze" responsive design that hides labels/text as the UI box is resized, rather than stacking vertically.
- **Slash Commands**: Added `/roll` and `/r` commands for manual dice rolling via the command bar.

### Fixed
- **Core Stability**: Resolved a critical initialization crash in the UI core caused by a missing API provider in the slash command registration.
- **Responsive Stacking**: Fixed a bug where footer buttons would stack vertically and misalign on narrow screens.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Tool Calling Compatibility**: Resolved a critical issue where the tracker would interrupt and break SillyTavern's internal tool-calling sequences.
  - Refactored the core event listener from `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` to `GENERATION_ENDED` (and `GENERATION_STOPPED`). The State Model will now patiently wait for the entire AI tool chain to finish before triggering an update, rather than firing in the "gaps" between tool execution steps.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-04-27

### Changed
- **Buff/Debuff Logic Overhaul**: Refactored how temporary effects and stat modifications are tracked.
  - Relocated "restoration anchors" to the stat lines themselves (e.g., `AC 18 (base 13)`), allowing for cleaner status displays.
  - Standardized Status line formatting to focus on absolute mathematical effects (e.g., `Shield (+5 AC, 1 turn)`).
  - Improved Narrator and State Model synergy for automatic buff expiration and stat restoration.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Mobile Profile Management**: Resolved an issue where saving, loading, or deleting profiles would fail on mobile devices (especially iOS PWAs).
  - Replaced native `prompt()` and `confirm()` calls with SillyTavern's built-in async modal system.
  - Implemented an async event-handling pattern for the Profile UI to support non-blocking user input.
- **RNG UI Tweak**: Integrated the RNG Physics Engine toggle directly into the footer navigation bar as a professional, horizontally-centered pill button with responsive mobile scaling.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **UI Boundary Protection**: Implemented safety checks to prevent the UI from becoming inaccessible if moved or saved off-screen.
  - Added coordinate sanitization to `loadPanelGeometry` and `createDetachedPanel` to ensure the panel always spawns within the visible viewport.
  - Implemented movement constraints in the dragging logic to prevent moving the panel header beyond the browser window edges.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Custom Field Limit**: Resolved a bug that limited the number of custom fields to two. 
  - Implemented unique tag generation for new fields (e.g., `NEW_FIELD`, `NEW_FIELD_1`).
  - Added real-time tag validation to prevent duplicate or reserved tags (like `XP` or `CHARACTER`).
  - Added an auto-sanitization pass to `refreshOrderList` to automatically fix any existing duplicate tags in user settings.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Starting Level Selector**: Added a "Starting Level" dropdown (Levels 1–20) to the initial setup screen. 
- **Dynamic Archetype Generation**: The Magic, Melee, and Rogue archetype buttons now dynamically generate characters consistent with your chosen starting level (including appropriate gear and spells).
- **Advanced D&D 5e Rules**: Updated `sysprompt.txt` with specific tracking for Distance & Range, Opportunity Attacks, and disadvantage on Ranged Spells in melee combat.
- **Archetype Overhaul**: Significantly improved the character generation "wizard".
  - All archetypes (Magic, Melee, Rogue) now consistently generate **[INVENTORY]** and **[ABILITIES]** blocks.
  - Numbered prompts ensure more thematic gear (Thieves' Tools, Signature Weapons) and class features (Sneak Attack).
- **Finalized Onboarding**: Completed the new user walkthrough in the empty state with descriptions and a manual creation guide.

### Changed
- **Ability Pill Formatting**: Updated the stock prompts to enforce the `Ability Name (brief description)` format, ensuring all class features render correctly as interactive UI pills.
- **Onboarding Guidance**: Added a reminder to the startup guide to reset extension prompts and re-copy the system prompt after a framework update.

### Fixed
- **Comma Support**: Updated the parser for HP, XP, and Hit Dice to support numbers with commas (e.g., `100,000`), preventing display failures with high-value stats.
- **UI Alignment**: Centered the level selector dropdown to sit correctly above the archetype selection buttons.

## [1.2.9] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Factory Reset**: Resolved a race condition where the page would reload before the reset request is finalized in storage. Replaced blocking alert with a non-blocking toast and delayed reload.

## [1.2.8] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Onboarding UX**: Fixed markdown bolding in the onboarding guide and scaled up all font sizes for better readability.
- **Profile Persistence**: The profile dropdown now correctly remembers the "-- No Profile --" selection across page refreshes.

- **Settings UI Sync**: Loading a profile now immediately updates the Module Settings list in the UI to reflect the loaded configuration.

### Changed
- **Enhanced Reset**: The "Reset ALL Prompts" button now also resets the module layout order and re-enables all stock modules to factory defaults.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Hit Dice Tracking (HD)**: Added a new `HD` field for Characters and Party members.
  - Renders as high-fidelity gold pips (`[ dX ] 🔵🔵⚪`) to differentiate from blue spell slots.
  - Automatically included in default system prompts.
- **Last Rest Time Engine**: The `[TIME]` section now supports a `Last Rest:` field.
  - The UI dynamically calculates and displays the time elapsed (e.g., "10 hours ago") relative to the current game time.

- **Standardized Spell UI**: Completely refactored the spell display format across the [PARTY] and [SPELLS] blocks.
  - Spells are now displayed using a low-cognition format (one line per spell level).
  - Fixed a grid-overflow bug in the PARTY UI that caused long spell names to stack vertically or clip.
  - Unified the horizontal-flowing pill layout for all spell levels.

### Changed
- **Manifest Update**: Optimized `manifest.json` for better integration with SillyTavern's third-party extension tracking.

## [2026-04-22] - UI & XP Enhancements

### Added
- **Character Level in XP Section**: Added character level display to the [XP] block, showing both level and experience progress in a single unified UI row.
- **Resource Depletion Logic**: The DM now strictly monitors resource usage. If a player attempts to use an ability or spell with 0 uses remaining, the DM will pause the narrative and request a different action.
- **Combat Field Expansion**: Enemies now track "Other" properties (Resistances, Immunities, Special Traits) with dedicated styling in the HUD.

### Changed
